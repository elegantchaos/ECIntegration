This repository is used internally for integration and unit testing of the EC frameworks.

It also illustrates how to make a worksheet and add multiple EC frameworks to it as submodules.

It should always contain references to compatible commits for the various frameworks - so it has an additional purpose as a way of documentating which framework versions work together.
